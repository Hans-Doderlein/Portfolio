## Description

The main purpose of this site is to showcase my deployed sites.

This website compiles all of my deployed sites, from the first site I ever deployed, to my most recent projects.

By creating this website I can showcase the development of my skills to future potential employers.

I also use this as a way to track my progress throughout my journey learning code.

This webpage contains information about me, my applications, and a contact section.
Included is a navbar that will jump to the chosen section when selected.
